# Neuron Net USDCHF

This code is a sample implementation of a neural network-based trading system for the USDCHF currency pair. It is developed by Forex Robot Easy Team and can be used for optimal trading in the forex market.

## Product Description

Neuron Net USDCHF is an AI-powered forex software designed to analyze market data and make optimal trading decisions for the USDCHF currency pair. It utilizes a neural network model trained on historical data to predict price variations and determine the best moments for entering and exiting trades.

The software is built using MQL5, a programming language specifically designed for trading systems. It connects to a Python program, which handles the data collection, processing, and prediction tasks. The PythonBridge library is used to establish communication between the MQL5 code and the Python program.

To use Neuron Net USDCHF, the following steps need to be followed:

1. Import the necessary libraries, including the PythonBridge library.
2. Define constants such as the symbol (USDCHF), timeframe (H1), lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.
3. Initialize the AI module by connecting to the Python program and loading the trained model.
4. Set up data collection and processing using the PythonBridge library.
5. Implement the trading logic in the Trade() function, which uses the predicted price to determine the optimal moments for entering and exiting trades.
6. In the OnTick() function, check if enough bars are available for prediction, collect and process data, and perform trading operations if the data is ready.
7. During program initialization (OnStart()), set up trading parameters and enable trading.
8. During program termination (OnDeinit()), disconnect from the Python program and disable trading.
